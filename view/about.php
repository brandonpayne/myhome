				  <p>There's a select few people that you get to keep around for your whole life, and that is your family.  I love and adore my parents and siblings so much.  I know without them I wouldn't have or be able to do a lot of the things that I do.  They support me in countless numbers of ways and I do my best to do the same for them.  (Going left to right: Brother in law Jake, Mother Andrea, Sister Christina, Father Jeff)  I can't leave out my great brother Eric and his Fiance Marryann.  I can't tell you how grateful I am for them.  </p>
					<p>There's a few things you need to know about me.  First, I'm hands down one of the biggest Utah Jazz fans you'll ever meet.  My dad and I have been going to every game for close to nine years now.  I love basketball, playing and watching.  I'm also a three time fantasy football champion.  Avid fan of the Minnesota Vikings.  Utah Ute fanatic in every way.  I have a huge passion for sports.</p>
					<p>I have a huge interest in Web Design and Marketing. I took one basic web class and I've been doing it ever since. I love marketing and advertising.  My dream job would be to work for Apple or Adobe as a Web Designer or Web Master.  I've made pages for actual companies before and I hope to keep going and maybe one day make a living off of this.</p>
